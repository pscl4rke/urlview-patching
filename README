This is a fork of Debian's version of `urlview`...

    https://salsa.debian.org/debian/urlview

...which I patched with a commit from a different version...

    https://github.com/sigpipe/urlview/commit/a9e1d573f301e39df4fbe77d2ee8896eeb90c692

...so that it exits after it launches the first link.

It's built in its own little docker container, and the binary
and deb package are copied out.

Like so...

    $ make image
    $ make copies
