This is a fork of Debian's version of `urlview`...

    https://salsa.debian.org/debian/urlview

...which I patched with a commit from a different version...

    https://github.com/sigpipe/urlview/commit/a9e1d573f301e39df4fbe77d2ee8896eeb90c692

...so that when QUITONLAUNCH is set in the config file it exits
after it launches the first link.

----

It's built in its own little container, and the binary
and deb package are copied out.

Like so...

    $ make image
    $ make copies

Originally it built a `urlview` package.  But now the
package it creates is called `urlview-patched` to avoid
some clashing problems I had.  It `Provides:` the original
package, which should ease installation.

----

As of 2024 someone else has restarted activity and merged in
lots of other patches...

    https://git.sr.ht/~nabijaczleweli/urlview-ng

...but as of 2025 they hadn't added QUITONLAUNCH support.
